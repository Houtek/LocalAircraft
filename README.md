# LocalAircraft
LocalAircraft.txt for use with Virtual Radar Server

If civil aircraft are incorrectly flagged as Military in Virtual Radar Server and visa-versa, this will fix it.

Download ``LocalAircraft.txt`` Place file in configuration of VRS and wait until the nightly refresh of the standing data. Don't expect this to work striaght away.

Windows install of VRS - to find the configuration folder go to ``Help | About`` and click the link to the configuration folder.

Linux - various, but look for ``~.local/share/VirtualRadar``
