# LocalAircraft
LocalAircraft.txt for use with Virtual Radar Server

If civil aircraft are incorrectly flagged as Military in Virtual Radar Server and visa-versa, this will fix it.

Place file in configuration of VRS and wait until the nightly refresh of the standing data. Don't expect this to work striaght away.
